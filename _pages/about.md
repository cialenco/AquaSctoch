This public website provides a one-stop comprehensive resource for researchers working on quantitative models of groundwater markets. We cover market design, empirical analysis, stochastic frameworks and economic perspectives on the emerging world of groundwater rights allocation, trading and usage tracking. 

This website is actively maintained by [Igor Cialenco](http://cialenco.com) and [Mike Ludkovski](https://ludkovski.pstat.ucsb.edu/).
